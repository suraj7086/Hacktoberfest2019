# Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Real life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristic.  Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

- Compile time Polymorphism
- Runtime Polymorphism
